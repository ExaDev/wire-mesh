/**
 * core/room's six verifier obligations (spec/room.cddl), layered on top of verifyCapabilityToken (obligations 2, 4, and 5 -- bearer match, ordinary token-claims checks, and delegations-remaining narrowing -- already live there). This module adds the two obligations specific to room-shaped scopes: the chain must terminate at the correct root for the path's own shape (1), and the token's own scope must actually name the room the request claims to act on (3). Obligation 6 (refuse an unrecognised content-type/kind) is a message-handling concern, not a token-verification one, and belongs to each consumer's own room verb router instead.
